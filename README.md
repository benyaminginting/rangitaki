## What is it?

My goal for Rangitaki was (and still is) to create a blogging engine without database dependencies (so you don't have to create database and tables and all that stuff) which is extremely easy and fast to setup and to learn. Rangitaki doesn't require any knowledge concerning PHP, JavaScript, HTML or CSS. You just need to know, how to upload something to your web server. There is also no need to compile anything, you just have to fill out twelve setting properties and then you can start writing your articles.

## So, what can it do?

 - Post writing in Markdown with a few keywords for the title, tags, date and the author (all optional)
 - Multiple blogs
 - A Subpages for each article with a comment box (Disqus; can be disabled)
 - Share buttons (FAB; can be disabled)
 - Disqus integration (can be disabled)
 - Fast and easy configuration
 - Google Analytics (optional)
 - Twitter and OpenGraph meta tags
 - Different themes
 - Easy localization (just 3 (!) strings)
 - Custom footer
 - Navigation drawer (can be disabled)
 - Tags
 - Set author and date
 - Mobile-first
 - JavaScript Extension Support
 - Pagination support
 - Rangitaki Control Center (RCC; optional, read the [RCC Documentation](https://marcel-kapfer.de/rangitaki/docs/rcc))
   - Online post upload
   - More will come...

## Did you say 'themes'?
