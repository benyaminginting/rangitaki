%TITLE: RCC stable

RCC (Rangitaki Control Center) is now in a stable state. Even if it has just one feature right now, it is an important one: uploading your posts from the web. To use it you have to manually enable it in the config.php and you must set a password in rcc/password.php. If you were using rangitaki in an earlier version you should really upgrade to the latest version, out of security reasons.

I will add more features to RCC in coming releases, including a media upload and other features.
